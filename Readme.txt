The script or notebook PerformFFT is used to analyze the data in the frequency domain. The script or notebook CutAndAverageData is used to cut data in time domain, average it, calculate measurement errors, and package it in one pickle file for the dipole fitting. The script or notebook AnalyseFittedData is used to plot the comparision between measurement and fit.

PerformFFT and CutAndAverageData can run with the provided data and params files. AnalyseFittedData, AnalyseFittedData_Field_at_He, PerformFitOptimization require pickles saved by CutAndAverageData which not included in the git repo but can be easily generated by running CutAndAverageData.

B_calc_script is just storing all the functions and will do nothing much if run on its own. It is imported by all the other files.

----------------------------------
** Update on November 18, 2021 **
----------------------------------
- Added AnalyseFittedData_Field_at_He notebook and script to use fitted dipoles and calculate the field at the intended location of the 3He sample. This code also converts the field from dipoles to frequency domain and estimates the amplitude at the rotation frequency and the measurement frequency (11 * f_rot)
- added functions in B_calc_script to implement the above
- modified some functions in B_calc_script to generalize them to be used by both AnalyseFittedData and AnalyseFittedData_Field_at_He
- Added the PerformFitOptimization code which was erroneously not included in the last push.
- removed CompareMeasuredAndFittedInFrequencyDomain which was included by errors
- updated Params/Exp2_dimensions_and_locations to more precise rotor dimensions, and a few locations inside the 3He sample volume
- added FittedDipoles_5Hz_3sources.pk and deleted Params_3sources.pk to update the location and moments of fitted dipoles
- minor changes to AnalyseFittedData, PerformFFT, and Cut-And-Average-Data related to directories and such

----------------------------------
** Update on December 7, 2021 **
----------------------------------
- Separated text commands for printing error function and fit results
- Added a gray box around fit results and error function
- Changed "\theta(units of pi)" to "\theta/pi" everywhere

----------------------------------
** Update on December 17, 2021 **
----------------------------------
- implemented automation of changing significant digits in fit parameters and error function, which also requires rotor dimensions to be truncated to the same number of significant figures.
- automated option to change printed significant digits in E, locations, dipole moments, and added footnote symbols on position and moment in fit figure
- updated Fit plot to have textbox that looks nice for both high sigfigs and low sigfigs
