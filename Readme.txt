The script or notebook PerformFFT is used to analyze the data in the frequency domain. The script or notebook CutAndAverageData is used to cut data in time domain, average it, calculate measurement errors, and package it in one pickle file for the dipole fitting. The script or notebook AnalyseFittedData is used to plot the comparision between measurement and fit.
